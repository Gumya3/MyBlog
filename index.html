                <h3 id="Chapter1">1. My First Week At Refactory</h3>
                <p>Hello there, my name is Asiimwe Mugumya and I am a student at <a href="https://www.refactory.ug/"
                        target="_blank">Refactory</a>.
                    I got to know about Refactory from a friend who is a developer and a software engineer.
                    I had expressed my interest to join the tech space to this friend and he encouraged me to apply for
                    the Refactory Catalyst Course. I applied for the course and here we are.
                </p>
                <p>My first week at Refactory was quite intimidating, to be honest although with time and courage, I
                    managed to pull through.
                    I met some new people. They have very cool and friendly facilitators there.
                    I also found that even though the classes were not physical, there were established communication
                    channels in place that helped me to get along with my fellow classmates.
                </p>
                <p>During the first week, we learnt about introduction to Software Engineering which was facilitated by
                    <a href="https://twitter.com/skapeyi" target="_blank">Samson Kapeyi</a>.
                    This module was theoretical for the beginning part where we learnt how the internet works.
                    Later on, the class became practical and we were introduced to things like Git, how to create online
                    repositories, how to write HTML, how to incorporate CSS and BOOTSTRAP in that HTML and it was quite
                    interesting.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3 id="Chapter2">2. My Second Week At Refactory</h3>
                <p>By the time we got to tehe second week of our study at Refactory, the sessions were mostly practical.
                    At this time, we were talking about Git in the Cloud, forming Git branches, pull requests and
                    merging. We also talked about the BOOTSTRAP GRID system during this week.
                </p>
                <p>Personally, this was largely my toughest week so far as I found it quite hard to keep up with the
                    rest of
                    the class. However, due to the fact that the classes are usually recorded, I was able to go back to
                    said recordings, revise them and cover up for the areas where I had missed.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3 id="Chapter3">3. My Overall Experience So Far</h3>
                <p>Notwithstanding the fact that I am still studying at <a href="https://www.refactory.ug/"
                        target="_blank">Refactory</a> and that I still have a lot more ground to cover in my journey to
                    become a software Engineer,
                    I have found my experince in undertaking the Refactory Catalyst Course to be quite educative and
                    exhilarating.
                    The modules here are not only centered about technology related subjects as there subjects here
                    which focus on development of good habits and general personal development.
                    We also have coaching sessions which are great because they help us to contextualise what is taught
                    in class.
                    I am very grateful for what I have so far learnt at Refactory and I look forward to more learning
                    and growth on this journey of becoming a developer.
